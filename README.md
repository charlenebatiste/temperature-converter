## General info

This project was built as a way to practice writing functions. The goals were to:

1. Input a Fahrenheit temperature and return a new temperature in Celcius and then to input a Celcius temperature to return a new temperature in Fahrenheit.
2. Change the new temperatures containers background color to red if the new temperature was hot or blue if the new temperature was freezing.

## Known Issues

Writing a single function that would move between the convertToCelsius and convertToFahrenheit functions. Without an option that moved between those two functions I was getting bugs in the second goal of this project. This was fixed with a helper function:

```javascript
function convertTemp() {
	if (tempSelector.value == "f_to_c") {
		convertToCelsius();
	}
	if (tempSelector.value == "c_to_f") {
		convertToFahrenheit();
	}
}
```
